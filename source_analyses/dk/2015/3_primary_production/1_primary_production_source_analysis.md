dd: 17/08/2018

##Remarks:

- Good sources for gas production and oil production see [3\_primary\_production\_source\_analysis.xlsm](3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm). Gas is from [Energinet Analysis Assumption 2017](2017_Energinet_Analysis_Assumptions_2017.xlsx) and oil is derived from [oil\_and\_gas\_in\_denmark\_2014_.pdf](oil_and_gas_in_denmark_2014_.pdf)
	- For the oil curve we needed to do some interpolation.
	- For both curves we needed to estimate the extraction between 2040 and 2050. We followed the trend of the most stabile last couple of years.
-  We currectly mis a good estimation for biomass. We took the current biomass consumption as a production curve and kept this stable. 
-  Denmark has no uraniam, lignite and/or coal production.
