# 6. Residences source analysis

The residences analysis is mad in july 2018 for the DK dataset 2015. The most recent Energy Balance from the IEA.  ML performed a top-down analysis for gas, oil, coal, and biomass and a bottom-up analysis for electricity use per appliance and per technology [6_residences_source_analysis_dk_2015.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis_dk_2015.xlsx).

			## Sources and assumptions		1. I used the total final demand split of space heating and hot water for gas, biomass, oil and district heating. From the source: JRC, 2012 'Heat and cooling demand and market perspective'

2. I built the electricity demand bottom-up, see the electricity sheet and the sub sheets: [6 residences source analysis dk 2015.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis_dk_2015.xlsx).

3. I split the final demand for cooking by Odyssee data, derived via [the online database from the European Commission] (https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/eu-buildings-database) . Everyone who has a gas heater uses gas cooking, every house which does not heat with gas, does also not cook with gas. 
4. The lighting demand is also derived via derived via [the online database from the European Commission] (https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/eu-buildings-database)  and the technology split is determined in the NL/2012 dataset 
The demand from the heat pumps is derived from Energinet, Analysis Assumptions 2017. 				## Final result		
## Old and new residences
Dutch split is currently taken. Old residences `74.96% `

New residences `25.04%`
