# 6. Residences source analysis

The residences analysis is made in August 2018 for the DK dataset 2015. The most recent Energy Balance from the IEA.  ML performed a top-down analysis for gas, oil, coal, and biomass and a bottom-up analysis for electricity use per appliance and per technology [6_residences_source_analysis_dk_2015.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis_dk_2015.xlsx).

			## Sources and assumptions		1. I used the total final demand split of space heating and hot water for gas, biomass, oil and district heating. From the source: '[Heat Roadmap Europe 2050, Fraunhofer Institute, 2015](HRE4 Exchange Template WP3_v22b_website.xlsx).

2. I built the electricity demand bottom-up, and used this split top-down see the electricity sheet and the sub sheets: [6 residences source analysis dk 2015.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis_dk_2015.xlsx).

## Debts
- Dutch split is currently taken. 	- Old residences `74.96% `
	-	New residences `25.04%`
- The bottom-up analysis of electricity was signifantly higher than the reported electricity on the energy balance. However the energy balance is still leading.
