#Transport


## Remarks

- The transport analysis is based on only two sources, however quite detailled ones:
	- AARHUS UNIVERSITY - DANISH EMISSION INVENTORIES FOR ROAD TRANSPORT AND OTHER MOBILE SOURCESM 2016: high over carrier split
	- Denmark Statistics, detailled split about the amount of vehicles. 
	- See [the transport\_source\_analysis excel] (8_transport_source_analysis.xlsx) for more details


##Debts
- The documentation of the choices in the Danish transport sector should be improved
