dd: 17/08/2018

##Remarks:
- No steel and aluminium industry, based on Energy Balance, World Steel Association and google search.
- Also no fertilizer industry, based on Energy Balance and google searcht. Yara has only a research centre and a distribution office/location. 
- Research needed to check electricity used for heating in chemistry, food and or paper industry. 
- The other sector is relatively quite big, this needs some attention, cause not more transition is yet possible in the energy transition model. 


## Debts
- It is assumped that all electricity in the chemical industry goes to general consumption and not to electric heating.
- For electric heating only data about heat pumps electricity use is found in the different sectors. It is assumed that the same amount of electricity is used for electric boilers.
