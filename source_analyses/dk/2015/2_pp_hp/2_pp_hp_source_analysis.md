dd: 24/07/2018

#Remarks: 
- **Electricity**: Denmark has a lot of CHPs, wind and some solar. The non-CHP power plants are nearly absent. Only a back-up of 570MW ancillary diesel engine plants is present. 
- Heat **plants**: Due to the lower heat efficiencies in our CHP analysis a lot of CHP heat is moved to the heat plants. 
- **Wind and solar analysis** can be found in [dk\_2015\_wind\_and\_ solar\_statistics.xlsx](dk_2015_wind_and solar_statistics.xlsx), main source:[Energinet Analysis Assumption 2017](2017_Energinet_Analysis_Assumptions_2017.xlsx) 
	- The wind data are very detailled and have split for land, near shore and offshore.
	- The solar data is contradicting. The full load hours of Energinet are not matching the full load hours we have calculated in dk\_2015\_wind\_and\_ solar\_statistics.xlsx](dk_2015_wind_and solar_statistics.xlsx). We have now chosen to let the full load hours and the energy from the energy balance (and our solar split) be leading which results in a lower installed capacity of 711 MW istead of 782. 


## Sources
### Energinet: 
- By far the most important source for this analysis is the information provided by [Energinet Analysis Assumption 2017](2017_Energinet_Analysis_Assumptions_2017.xlsx)
