# 3. Primary production analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the DE 2011 dataset. The timecurves are based on data from the Primes reference scenario, see the `3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm` for more details.


## Wood

The domestic production of wood is set to 34,309 PJ. This value is estimated from the production of 'fuelwood' reported by Eurostat (for_basic database). See [wood_source_analysix.xlsx](../../eu/2012/3_primary_production/wood_source_analysis.xlsx).


## Waste

The maximum domestic production of biogenic waste and non-biogenic waste are set to resp. 55,993 TJ and 55,993 TJ. These values are estimated from the current volume of 'waste incineration with energy recovery' and the potential available volume for 'waste incineration with energy recovery' (i.e. volumes reported for 'waste incineration without energy recovery' and the 'deposited waste', reported by Eurostat (env_wasmun database). See [waste_source_analysix.xlsx](../../eu/2012/3_primary_production/waste_source_analysis.xlsx).
