# 6. Residences analysis


## Application split

The final demand for space heating, hot water, lighting, cooking and appliances are estimated roughly based on the SECH-SPAHOUSEC study. See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx) for more details. 


## Space heating

The technology split for space heating are based on Ecofys data. The percentages are adjusted manually to match the IEA energy demand.

| :---------------------------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| Condensing combi boiler       |        0.0% |        0.0% |
| Solar thermal panels          |        0.0% |        2.1% |
| Gas-fired heat pump (ground)  |        0.0% |        0.0% |
| Gas-fired micro CHP           |        0.0% |        0.0% |

| Electricity-driven heat pump  |        0.6% |        0.6% |
| Woodpellets (biomass) heaters |       27.8% |       28.9% |
| Electric heaters (resistance) |       37.9% |       14.7% |
| Gas-fired heaters             |       24.5% |       23.7% |
| Oil-fired heaters             |        9.1% |       28.9% |
| Coal-fired heaters            |        0.0% |        1.0% |
| Electric heat pump add-on     |        0.1% |        0.1% |


## Hot water

The technology split for hot water are based on Ecofys data. The percentages are adjusted manually to match the IEA energy demand. 


| Technology                    | Calc. share | Final share |
| :---------------------------- | ----------: | ----------: |
| Condensing combi boiler       |        0.0% |        0.0% |
| Solar thermal panels          |        0.0% |        2.0% |
| Gas-fired heat pump (ground)  |        0.0% |        0.0% |
| Gas-fired micro CHP           |        0.0% |        0.0% |
| District heating              |        0.0% |        0.0% |
| Electricity-driven heat pump  |        0.1% |        0.1% |
| Woodpellets (biomass) heaters |        5.2% |        8.0% |
| Electric heaters (resistance) |       61.1% |       41.2% |
| Gas-fired heaters             |       24.5% |       26.2% |
| Oil-fired heaters             |        9.1% |       21.4% |
| Coal-fired heaters            |        0.0% |        1.1% |
| Electric heat pump add-on     |        0.0% |        0.0% |


## Space cooling

There is no data available for space cooling. It is assummed that all space cooling is accomplished by conventional air conditioning.


## Lighting

The technology shares for lighting are based on based on SECH-SPAHOUSEC data. See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx). 


## Cooking

The technology shares for cooking are based on based on SECH-SPAHOUSEC data. See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx). 


## Appliances

The technology shares for appliances are based on based on SECH-SPAHOUSEC data. See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx). 


## Debts

- There is a large discrepancy between the Ecofys data and the optimized values w.r.t. space heating and hot water: share of electric technologies is lower, share of oil technologies is higher.
- Split between old en new houses need to be researched.
