## 10. Other analysis

*The Example country is created to show the whole dataset generation process, including the steps that involve obtaining and preparing energy balances - either the proprietary IEA energy balance, or the open source Eurostat enery balance. The Example country is based on a dummy energy balance that is created from the IEA energy balances of two European countries.*

No dashboard input required in the Other analysis.

A check indicated that the ETM does not pick up all 'other' IEA energy carriers.

In the sector "Non-specified (other)", the following IEA carrier are currently not picked up in the fuel aggregation.

- Geothermal: 16 TJ
- Solar thermal: 1820 TJ

Consequently, these carriers are also not considered by the queries on etsource.
