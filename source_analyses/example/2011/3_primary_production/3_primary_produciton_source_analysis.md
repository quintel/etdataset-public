# 3. Primary production analysis

*The Example country is created to show the whole dataset generation process, including the steps that consider proprietary IEA energy balances. The Example country is therefore based on a *dummy* energy balance that is created from the IEA energy balances of two European countries.*

The assumptions in the Primary production analysis are filled 'nicely' and are not based on sources.

- 'Maximum biogenic waste and non-biogenic waste production' is set to appr. 2x the actual production, i.e. resp. 120 PJ and 180 PJ.
- 'Wood production' is set to the 'Total primary energy supply of primary solid biofuels', which is appr. 300 PJ.
- 'Wood pellet production' and 'Torrified biomass pellets' production share are estimated at resp. 75% and 25%.

Refer to the source analyses of NL, DE and EU for well-researched examples of the Primary production source analyses:
