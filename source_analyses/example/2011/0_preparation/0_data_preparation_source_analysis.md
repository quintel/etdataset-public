*The Example country is created to show the whole dataset generation process, including the steps that involve obtaining and preparing energy balances - either the proprietary IEA energy balance, or the open source Eurostat enery balance. The Example country is based on a dummy energy balance that is created from the IEA energy balances of two European countries.*
