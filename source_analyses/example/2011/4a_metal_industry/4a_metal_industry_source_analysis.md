# 4a. Metal industry analysis

*The Example country is created to show the whole dataset generation process, including the steps that consider proprietary IEA energy balances. The Example country is therefore based on a *dummy* energy balance that is created from the IEA energy balances of two European countries.*

The assumptions in the Metal industry analysis are filled 'nicely' and are not based on sources.

- Steel production is optimized such that the transformation production efficiencies (TJ/MT) on the 'Steel and aluminium final demand' match the NL values. The resulting steel production is 20 MT.
- Aluminium production is assumed to be 1.25 MT. It is made sure that the Final demand electricity in other metals remains positive.
