# 8. Transport analysis

*The Example country is created to show the whole dataset generation process, including the steps that consider proprietary IEA energy balances. The Example country is therefore based on a *dummy* energy balance that is created from the IEA energy balances of two European countries.*

The assumptions in the Transport analysis are filled 'nicely' and are not based on sources.

Refer to the source analyses of NL, DE and EU for well-researched examples of the Transport source analyses:
