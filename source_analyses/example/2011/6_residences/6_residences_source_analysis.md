# 6. Residences analysis

*The Example country is created to show the whole dataset generation process, including the steps that consider proprietary IEA energy balances. The Example country is therefore based on a *dummy* energy balance that is created from the IEA energy balances of two European countries.*

The assumptions in the Residences analysis are filled so that all checks pass and are not based on sources.
