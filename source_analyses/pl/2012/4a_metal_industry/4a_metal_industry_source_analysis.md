# 4a. Metal industry analysis


## Steel

- The steel production is set to 8.366 MT. This value is taken from the [World Steel Assosiation (WSA)](http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1878) (Table 6).
- The share of blast furnaces and electric furnaces is set to resp. 50.6% and 49.4%. This value is also taken from the [WSA](http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1878) (Table 6).


## Aluminium

- The aluminium production is set to 0.047 MT. This value is taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_aluminium_production), data from 2009. Beware: you need to fill in the production of aluminium, not of aluminium oxide.


## Debts

- There is a lot of unmodelled coal transformation in the metal sector. This is cause by an 'overproduction' of cokes. (Transformation output of cokes ovens is appr. 250 PJ, where the final demand is only appr. 27 PJ.)
- Even with 100% coal gas input in the blast furnace burner, the unmodelled final demand of coal gas is 5.8 PJ.
