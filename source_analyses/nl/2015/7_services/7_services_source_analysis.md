# 7. Services analysis


## Application splits

The application split and technology shares are calculated in the [7&#95;services&#95;source&#95;analysis.xlsx](7_services_source_analysis.xlsx). 

The split for final demand is based on a breakdown by [Energiecijfers databank](https://energiecijfers.databank.nl/jive?cat_open_var=db_ggv_hh&var=db_ggv_hh&geolevel=nederland&favorite=nederland_1) which splits space heating, space cooling, lighting.

On the 'Electricity' sheet it is decided how much of the final demand for electricity is used by which application. 

## Space heating

CBS only provides data about installed capacity and delivered heat for agriculture and utilities sector combined.It is assumed that the split of heat pumps between the agriculture and the utilities sector is the same as for the 2013 dataset.

## Space cooling

For cooling the same share of heat pump technologies is assumes as for heating, the remaining demand is supplied by airconditioning

## Lighting

The technology share of the lighting sector is base on information from an "expert". For details see [lighting&#95;source&#95;analysis](lighting_source_analysis.xlsx).

## Other

The remaining final demand is atrributed to the "other" sector.
