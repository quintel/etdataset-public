# 4a. Metal industry analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the NL 2011 dataset.


## Steel

- The steel production is set to 6.995 MT. This value is taken from the [World Steel Assosiation (WSA)](https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2066) (Table 6).
- The share of blast furnaces and electric furnaces is set to resp. 98.5% and 1.5%%. This value is taken from the [WSA](https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2066) (Table 6).
- The ratio of coal gas and network gas in the blast furnace burner is optimized to reduce the error in coal gas final consumption not modelled.


| Technology | Share                             |
| :--------- | -------------------------------:  | 
| Percentage of input from coal (and cokes)      |  0.0 |  
| Percentage of input from coal gas	             | 69.9%|    
| Percentage of input from network gas           | 30.1% |    


## Aluminium

- The aluminium production is set to 0.075 MT. This value is taken from [USGS 2015 minerals yearbook - aluminum](https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2067) table 13.

The aluminium production in The Netherlands has been turbulent since 2013. Alden (later Klesch) in Delfzijl has had multiple bankrupties and made several restarts.

Data regarding the technology shares is not available, the same split as for 2013 (which is based on 2011) has been used.
