# 4b. Chemical industry analysis


### Chemical other sector
In 2017 3 additional technologies were added to the ETM: resistive heaters, heat pumps and steam recompression. These are technologies that are currently not in use. Therefore:


|Input|Share|
|---|---|
|General electricity consumption|100%|
|Electricity consumption for resistive heaters|0%|
|Electricity consumption for heat pumps|0%|
|Electricity consumption for steam recompression|0%|


General electricity consumption: 100%


### Fertilizer

- The fertilizer sector requires the user to set both the energetic and non-energetic final consumption. These values are taken from [CBS Staline](https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/en/dataset/83989ENG/table), Energy balance sheet; supply and consumption, sector, with selected sector "2015 Manufacture of fertilizers".

- The fertilizer sector also requires setting emission shares for CCS. These values are taken from the MIDDEN report from [PBL & TNO](https://www.pbl.nl/en/publications/decarbonisation-options-for-the-dutch-fertiliser-industry), Decarbonisation options for the Dutch fertiliser industry.
