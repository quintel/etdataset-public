# Main issues with the NL 2012 dataset

## General


## Specific

- (CHP and PP&HP) The installed capacities requires validation!

- (CHP) The calculated fuel input for electricity and sold heat production is lower than the reported fuel input. See [1_chp_source_analysis](1_chp/1_chp_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (PP&HP) Technology shares for coal and gas need to be researched. See [2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis](2_power_and_heat_plant/2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis.md#debts). 

- (PP&HP) FLH need to be researched. See [2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis](2_power_and_heat_plant/2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis.md#debts). 

- (Residences) Technology shares for heating technologies need optimization. See [6_residences_source_analysis](6_residences/6_residences_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Residences) Application split and technology shares need to be updated for 2012. See [6_residences_source_analysis](6_residences/6_residences_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Services) The source analysis for the NL 2011 data should be reviewed and reapplied for the NL 2012 dataset. The  [7_alternative_services_source_analysis.xlsx](7_alternative_services_source_analysis.xlsx) can be used as validation. See [7_services_source_analysis](7_services/7_services_source_analysis.md#debts).
