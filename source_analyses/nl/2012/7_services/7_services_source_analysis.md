# 7. Services analysis

The assumption in the services analysis are all based on the NL 2011 values. Application splits and technology shares are calculated in the [7_alternative_services_source_analysis.xlsx](7_alternative_services_source_analysis.xlsx), but currently NOT used yet.


## Debts

- The source analysis for the NL 2011 data should be reviewed and reapplied for the NL 2012 dataset. The  [7_alternative_services_source_analysis.xlsx](7_alternative_services_source_analysis.xlsx) can be used as validation.
