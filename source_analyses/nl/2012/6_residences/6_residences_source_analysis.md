# 6. Residences analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the NL 2011 dataset.


## Application split

A first attempt of the calculation of the application split based on [Enerdata_2014_Energy efficiency trends for households in the EU](http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1868) is made in [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx). These values are not used yet.


## Lighting

The technology shares for lighting are calculated based on the number of lamps per households reported in [GfK_2011_Rapportage marktwerking lampenverkoop in Nederland](http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1879). See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx).


## Debts

- Technology shares for heating technologies need optimization.
- Application split and technology shares need to be updated for 2012.
