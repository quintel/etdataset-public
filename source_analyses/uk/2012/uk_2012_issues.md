# Main issues with the UK 2012 dataset

## General


## Specific

- (Preparation) The three additional columns in the IEA energy balance should be addressed in our analysis. See [0_data_preparation_source_analysis](0_preparation/0_data_preparation_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Primary Production) Max production of waste carriers is lower than the actual production of waste carriers. The max production need to be adapted and a check is required to avoid this issue in the future. See [3_primary_production_source_analysis](3_primary_production/3_primary_production_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Metal) There is a lot of unmodelled coal transformation in the metal sector. See [4a_metal_industry_source_analysis](4a_metal_industry/4a_metal_industry_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Residences) Split between old en new houses need to be researched. See [6_residences_source_analysis](6_residences/6_residences_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Services) Demand for other carriers is appr. 1,8 PJ. This energy use is not accounted for in the ETM. See [7_services_source_analysis](7_services/7_services_source_analysis.md#debts).
