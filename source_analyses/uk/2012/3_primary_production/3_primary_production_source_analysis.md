# 3. Primary production analysis

The timecurves are based on data from the Primes reference scenario in [EC_2016_Trends to 2050 reference scenario 2016](https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2096). Values for 2012 are directly obtained from the energy balance. See the [3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm](3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm) for more details.


## Wood

The domestic production of wood is set to 11,718 PJ. This value is estimated from the production of 'fuelwood' reported by Eurostat (for_basic database). See [wood_source_analysix.xlsx](../../eu/2012/3_primary_production/wood_source_analysis.xlsx).


## Waste

The maximum domestic production of biogenic waste and non-biogenic waste are set to resp. 140,483 TJ and 138,451 TJ. These values are estimated from the current volume of 'waste incineration with energy recovery' and the potential available volume for 'waste incineration with energy recovery' (i.e. volumes reported for 'waste incineration without energy recovery' and the 'deposited waste', reported by Eurostat (env_wasmun database). See [waste_source_analysix.xlsx](../../eu/2012/3_primary_production/waste_source_analysis.xlsx).


## Debts

- Max production of waste carriers is lower than the actual production of waste carriers. The max production need to be adapted and a check is required to avoid this issue in the future.
