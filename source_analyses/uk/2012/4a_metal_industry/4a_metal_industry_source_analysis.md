## Aluminium

- The aluminium production is set to 0.253 MT. This value is taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_aluminium_production), data from 2009. Beware: you need to fill in the production of aluminium, not of aluminium oxide.


## Debts

- There is a lot of unmodelled coal transformation in the metal sector.
- [SOLVED] The final demand of natural gas in the other industry sector is below zero. Might be result from the usage of other fuels in the metal industry.
