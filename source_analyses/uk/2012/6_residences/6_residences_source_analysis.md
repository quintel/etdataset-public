# 6. Residences analysis


## Application split

The final demand for space heating, hot water, lighting, cooking and appliances are based on based on ECUK data. See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx). The sum of the final demands calculated from the ECUK data exceed the total final energy demand for residences on the energy balance. The values are therefore scaled to match the total final energy demand.

## Space cooling

There is no data available for space cooling. It is assummed that all space cooling is accomplished by conventional air conditioning.


## Lighting

The technology shares for lighting are based on based on ECUK data. See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx). 


## Cooking

The technology shares for cooking are based on based on ECUK data. See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx). 


## Appliances

The technology shares for appliances are based on based on ECUK data. See [6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx](6_residences_source_analysis.xlsx). 


## Debts

- Split between old en new houses need to be researched.
