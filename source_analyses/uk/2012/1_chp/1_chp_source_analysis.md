# 1. CHP analysis


## DUKES

The following dashboard values have been taken from Digest of United Kingdom Energy Statistics (DUKES) 2013. The specific Tables used are indicated in the dashboard comments.

* The fuel allocation method used by your country's statistical agency
* Total heat production by CHPs (estimate, only relevant for checks)
* Total fuel input into CHPs (estimate, only relevant for checks)


## Irrelevant dashboard values

The following dashboard values are not relevant for UK 2012 as there is no autoproduction from CHPs for that sector and I have set them to 50%.

### Agriculture
* Percentage of heat from gas CHPs that is not sold
* Percentage of heat from wood pellet CHPs that is not sold
* Percentage of remaining CHP electricity production by gas CHPs

### Households
* Percentage of heat from gas CHPs that is not sold
* Percentage of heat from wood pellet CHPs that is not sold
* Percentage of remaining CHP electricity production by gas CHPs


## Split between gas engine, turbine and combined cycle CHPs

The Platts data provides some data on electricity generated by fuel and CHP technology.

* Percentage of CHP electricity production by gas turbine CHPs: 26.3%
* Percentage of CHP electricity production by gas engine CHPs: 1.8%
* Percentage of CHP electricity production by gas combined cycle: 71.9%

See [uk_2012_installed_capacities.xlsm](../2_power_and_heat_plant/uk_2012_installed_capacities.xlsm) for the calculations. We assume that this split is the same for the Energy Industry and Industry.
