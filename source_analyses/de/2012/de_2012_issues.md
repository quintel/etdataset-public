# Main issues with the DE 2012 dataset

## General


## Specific

- (Preparation) The three additional columns in the IEA energy balance should be addressed in our analysis. See [0_data_preparation_source_analysis](0_preparation/0_data_preparation_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Preparation) The PV shift should be performed using the Ecofys data on the solar PV shares in main activity, households and services. See [0_data_preparation_source_analysis](0_preparation/0_data_preparation_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (PP&HP, Coal and Lignite) Current FLH are slightly to low to match the installed capacity by Platts (ETM: 50.8 GW, Platts: 46.8 GW). See [2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis](2_power_and_heat_plant/2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (PP&HP, Wind) Shares between inland and coastal wind requires research. See [2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis](2_power_and_heat_plant/2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (PP&HP, Wind) Methodology for wind should be described in source analysis. See [2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis](2_power_and_heat_plant/2_power_and_heat_plant_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Chemical) Negative final demand for woodpellets. Most likely cause by allocation in CHP analysis. See also [ETdataset#175](https://github.com/quintel/etdataset/issues/175). See [4b_chemical_industry_source_analysis](4a_chemical_industry/4a_chemical_industry_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Residences) The technology splits for space cooling, lighting, cooking and appliances requires research. See [6_residences_source_analysis](6_residences/6_residences_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Residences) The split between old en new houses need to be researched. nSee [6_residences_source_analysis](6_residences/6_residences_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Services) The technology split for lighting requires more research. See [7_services_source_analysis](7_services/7_services_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Services) Demand for other carriers is appr. 49 PJ. This energy use is not accounted for in the ETM. See [7_services_source_analysis](7_services/7_services_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Area) More research and validation is required. See [11_area_data_source_analysis](11_area_data/11_area_data_source_analysis.md#debts).

- (Area) Onshore and offshore wind potential requires more research. See [11_area_data_source_analysis](11_area_data/11_area_data_source_analysis.md#debts).
