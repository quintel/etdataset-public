# 4b. Chemical industry analysis

This analysis does not require any inputs by the user. All calculations are based on the energy balance.


## Debts

- Negative final demand for woodpellets. Most likely cause by allocation in CHP analysis. See also [ETdataset#175](https://github.com/quintel/etdataset/issues/175).
- Non-zero final demand for coal gas (7.2 PJ). This final demand will be excluded in the ETM.
