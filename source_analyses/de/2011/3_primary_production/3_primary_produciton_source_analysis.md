# 3. Primary production analysis

1. All time curves were directly taken from the Quintel's old dataset in the Input Excel tool. All six time curves are outdated, the original source is an estimate by an AT Kearney consultant.
* The "Domestic production in 2011" of Bio-oil, Algae diesel and Wood is set to 0 - as it is the case in the NL model. This is not correct, Germany is a producer of wood.
* The "Maximum domestic production in 2011" of Biogenic waste and Non-biogenic waste is not researched properly. Instead, the respective domestic production (extracted form the energy balance) is used (numbers are increased by 10%).
* The "Wood pellet production" is also estimated, without proper research:

````
    Percentage of wood converted to wood pellets: 75.0%
    Percentage of wood converted to torrified biomass pellets: 25.0%
````


## Required improvements:

All DE time curves are outdated. The original source of the research data is not clear. All other dashboard inputs are rough estimates and require additional research.
