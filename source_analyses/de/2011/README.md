*Disclaimer: Most of the DE 2011 dataset is not researched very well. The main purpose in setting up the DE dataset was to show that the research analyses could cope with a non NL dataset. Many dashboard inputs are inspired by the old DE dataset that was not based on the input data generation process via research analysis, but on the Input Excel tool.*
