# 6. Residences analysis

1. Application split: Final energy demand: Originally, this application split was based on the NL dataset. The final demands were scaled up proportionally until they reached the total final demand. However, it was not possible to make the checks pass with those settings. Therefore, the application split was further manipulated, to optimise the checks. Further research and validation is needed.
* Technology split: Space heating: Percentages are adjusted manually until the IEA energy demands are matched. Further research and validation is needed.
* Technology split: Hot water: Percentages are adjusted manually until the IEA energy demands are matched. The hot water split should complement the space heating split. Further research and validation is needed.
* Technology split: Space cooling: All space cooling is accomplished by conventional air conditioning.
* Technology split: Cooking: This split has been taken directly from the NL dataset. Further research and validation is needed.
* Technology split: Appliances: This split has been taken directly from the NL dataset. Further research and validation is needed.


## Additional dashboard inputs

The following has been taken from the old Input Excel tool. This data is outdated and needs to be researched.

Old / New Houses Split
	Percent of new houses (built before 1992) 86.00%
	Percent of old houses (built after 1991)  14.00%

	Average R-value of a typical old residence (built before 1992)	m2K/W	0.50
	Average R-value of a typical new residence (built after 1991)	m2K/W	1.80

## Required improvements

The values mentioned above need to be properly researched.
