# 11. Area analysis

The area data is created in the [Area analysis](../../../../analyses/11_area_analysis.xlsx) and exported in a de.ad file.
The analysis is still in development (see e.g. issue [#373](https://github.com/quintel/etdataset/issues/373).

For the time being, the area data is made up of 'old' numbers that were probably researched by Mark den Heijer.


## Required improvements

We need justification of the following topics that are part of the area data:

- Population
- Infrastructure cost for electricity and gas grid
- Available and areable land, lenght of coast
- Roof areas, land areas for solar PV and wind
- insulation data for buildings and old/new residences
- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions figures and costs
- Employment information
- Electricity export capacity
- Car and truck kilometers

See the [EU](../../../eu/2011/11_area_data/11_area_data_source_analysis.md) source analysis as example for improvements.
