# 4a. Metal industry analysis

1. The steel production is set to 44.288 MT. This value is taken from the [German Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stahl/Tabellen_und_Grafiken), data from 2011.
* The distribution over steel furnaces (technology split) is adjusted so that checks are optimised.
* The aluminium production is set to 450 kT. This value is taken from the [English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_aluminium_production), data from 2009. Beware: you need to fill in the production of aluminium, not of aluminium oxide.
