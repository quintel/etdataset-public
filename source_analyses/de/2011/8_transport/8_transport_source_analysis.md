# 8. Transport analysis

There are only four inputs to make into the DE transport analysis dashboard:

1. Trucks do not drive on gasoline.
* Diesel consumption by cars vs trucks: This share is taken from the NL dataset. Research is required for Germany.
* Trucks do not drive on electricity.
* Trucks do not drive on compressed gas.


## Required improvements

The split if diesel consumption over trucks and cars needs to be properly researched and validated by sources.
