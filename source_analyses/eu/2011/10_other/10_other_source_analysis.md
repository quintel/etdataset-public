## Other analysis

No dashboard input required in the 'Other' analysis. 

A check indicates that the ETM does not pick up all 'other' IEA energy carriers. 

The following IEA demands are currently not picked up in the fuel aggregation, although they are not zero: 

"Non-specified (other)"

- Municipal waste (renewable)	
- Municipal waste (non-renewable)
- Biogasoline
- Other liquid biofuels
- Geothermal
- Solar thermal

"Non-energy use in other"

- Coking coal
- Coal tar

In total, these neglected demands amount to 20 PJ. 
Consequently, these carriers are also not considered by the queries on etsource.
