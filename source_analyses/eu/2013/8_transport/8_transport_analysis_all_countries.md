#8. Transport Analysis (all countries)

This document describes how the initial values for all natural gas related shares in transport were found. 

##Energy consumed per type

The Natural Gas Vehicle Association (NVGA) collects information on the number of natural gas vehicles, and whether they are low duty (LD, cars) or heavy duty (HD, trucks) vehicles and whether they run on LNG or CNG. These numbers were multiplied with the average mileage and efficiency per type of vehicle and fuel to determine the total energy consumed by every fuel (CNG/LNG) and vehicle (LD/HD) combination. These average mileage and efficiency come from the respective nodes source analyses. Note: the LNG/LD combination  is not observed and not modelled either for technical reasons (urban transport involves a more irregular driving behaviour, while vaporisation of LNG continues when a car stops).

##Shares

Then, from the total energy consumed per combination given in the first two columns, the CNG/LD:CNG/HD and LNG/HD:CNG/(LD+HD) ratio can be determined. Those numbers are then used as input values.
