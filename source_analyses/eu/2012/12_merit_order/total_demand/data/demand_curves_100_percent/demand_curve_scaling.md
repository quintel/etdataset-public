## Demand curves scaled to 100% of national value
_____

In this folder the demand curves for each country have been scaled to 100% of the national demand. The scaling factor is equal to the peak demand in the unscaled curve and the corresponding value for peak demand in the [2012_ENTSO-E_Memo.pdf](../demand_curves_100_percent/2012_ENTSO-E_Memo.pdf). Each time we verified that the reported peak demand moments in the memo and the curve are the same.

The resulting scaled curves are useful for comparison with the curves ultimately used by the merit module.
