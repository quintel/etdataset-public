# 6. Residences analysis


## Application split

The final demand for space heating, hot water, lighting, cooking and appliances are estimated roughly based on the Odyssee 2011 data. The 2011 values are scaled to the final demand in 2012 taken from the IEA energy balance.


## Space heating

The technology split for space heating are based on Ecofys data. The percentages are adjusted manually to match the IEA energy demand.

## Debts

- The technology splits for space cooling, lighting, cooking and appliances requires research.
- Split between old en new houses need to be researched.
