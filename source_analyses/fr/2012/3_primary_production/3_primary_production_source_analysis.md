# 3. Primary production analysis

The timecurves are based on data from the Primes reference scenario in [EC_2013_Trends to 2050 reference scenario 2013](http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1874). Values for 2012 are directly obtained from the energy balance. See the [3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm](3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm) for more details.


## Wood

The domestic production of wood is set to 231,286 PJ. This value is estimated from the production of 'fuelwood' reported by Eurostat (for_basic database). See [wood_source_analysix.xlsx](../../eu/2012/3_primary_production/wood_source_analysis.xlsx).


## Waste

The maximum domestic production of biogenic waste and non-biogenic waste are set to resp. 102,035 TJ and 102,035 TJ. These values are estimated from the current volume of 'waste incineration with energy recovery' and the potential available volume for 'waste incineration with energy recovery' (i.e. volumes reported for 'waste incineration without energy recovery' and the 'deposited waste', reported by Eurostat (env_wasmun database). See [waste_source_analysix.xlsx](../../eu/2012/3_primary_production/waste_source_analysis.xlsx).
