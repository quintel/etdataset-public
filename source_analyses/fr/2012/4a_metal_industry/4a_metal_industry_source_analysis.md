# 4a. Metal industry analysis


## Steel

- The steel production is set to 15.609 MT. This value is taken from the [World Steel Assosiation (WSA)](http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1878) (Table 6).
- The share of blast furnaces and electric furnaces is set to resp. 60.9% and 39.1%. This value is taken from the [WSA](http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1878) (Table 6).
- The ratio of coal gas and network gas in the blast furnace burner is optimized to reduce the error in coal gas final consumption not modelled.


## Aluminium

- The aluminium production is set to 0.349 MT. This value is taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_aluminium_production), data from 2009. Beware: you need to fill in the production of aluminium, not of aluminium oxide.


## Debts

- There is some unmodelled coal transformation as result of 'overproduction' of cokes. Nevertheless, cokes production in the cokes oven < cokes input in blast furnace and + final demand. Consequently, there is appr 20 PJ cokes import in France.
