### River

We use a flat profile generated in `river_flat_curve.py`.

Previously we based the profile for hydro energy on flow rates of the river Maas combined with the power curve of hydro power plants. However, historic flow rates are no longer (publically) available. Furthermore, the installed capacity of hydro power is very small in The Netherlands ~ 40 MW. Therefor we decided to use a flat curve.
