## Solar curve NL 2015

The data from the OPSD platform is incomplete for NL 2015. Therefor we use SoDa-data.

The hourly solar pv load profile is based on [SoDa data](http://www.soda-is.com/eng/index.html). 
We exported the hourly solar data for the center of the Netherlands 
(52°30' N, 5°45' E, according to the 
[CIA World Fact Book](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2011.html)) 
for 2004 and 2005. 
If available, we use the 2005 value for a specific hour in the year. 
If this is not available, we use the 2004 value for this hour. 
As with all load profiles, we normalize the load profiles to 1/3600.
