## Solar thermal production curves

The output of solar thermal panels is not directly related to solar irradiance. It depends on the thermal capacity of the solar thermal panels, on global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and on current temperature difference between the fluid and the ambient temperature.

For countries other than the Netherlands we determine GHI from direct normal irradiance (DNI) and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI).

The readme's in the script folder describe how we model the output of solar thermal panels.

We use the following sources:

* Panel specifications: [Arcon-Sunmark HT-SolarBoost 35/10](https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2106)
* Irradiation data The Netherlands: [KNMI](https://knmy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Irradiation data other countries: [Open Power System Data](https://data.open-power-system-data.org/weather_data/)
Panel specifications are based on
