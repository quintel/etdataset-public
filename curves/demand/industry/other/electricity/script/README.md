### Electricity demand for other industry - script
The data needs to be processed in order to match the ETM format. The input data (NEDU E3D profile, see ⁨etdataset⁩ ▸ ⁨curves⁩ ▸ ⁨demand⁩ ▸ ⁨industry ▸ ⁨other ▸ ⁨electricity ▸ ⁨data⁩ ▸ ⁨nl⁩ ▸ ⁨source⁩) provides electricity demand per 15 minute interval.

By running the `industry_other.py` script, the profile is transformed to a normalized hourly profile that matches the required ETM format.
