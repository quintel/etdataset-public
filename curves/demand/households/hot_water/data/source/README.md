### Hot water demand households - source

With the data from Jordan (2001) it is possible to generate individual curves as well as a distribution function. 

The script `probability_distribution_hot_water.py` is used to generate an aggregated domestic hot water curve. The script is based in great part on Realistic Domestic Hot-Water Profiles in Different Time Scales, Jordan (2001). See folder "source".
