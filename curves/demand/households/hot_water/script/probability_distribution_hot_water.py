#==============================================================================
# This script can be used to generate typical domestic hot water (DHW) profiles
# for a period of one year and time steps of 1 hour . The script is based in
# great part on Realistic Domestic Hot-Water Profiles in Different Time Scales,
# Jordan (2001). This study assumes a daily average DHW use of 200 liters and
# distinguishes four types of DHW consumption, each with an associated volume
# and average daily occurence:
#
# type A: short load (1 liter per event, 28 occurences per day)
# type B: medium load (6 liter per event, 12 occurences per day)
# type C: bath (140 liter per event, 0.143 occurences per day (once a week))
# type D: shower (40 liter per event, 2 occurences per day)
#
# According to Jordan (2001), the duration of each of these types is shorter 
# than 15 minutes (i.e. the time resolution of our simulation). Hence we 
# decided to only model the probability that an event occurs within each 15 
# minute time step and assign the entire volume of that event to that 15 minute
# bin. The probability of each type of event varies throughout the year (i.e.
# slightly more DHW consumption in winter), throughout the week (more in the
# weekend) and throughout the day (no DHW consumption during the night).
