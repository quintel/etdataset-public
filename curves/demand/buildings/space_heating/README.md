### Building demand space heating - source

The space heating demand profile for the Buildings/Services sector follows the 'G2A' demand curve provided by Gasunie Transport Services / NEDU. This is a demand curve for natural gas users in the Netherlands using > 5000 m3 per year.

For recent years (2015 onwards) this data is retrieved from the yearly 'gas balance' provided by Gasunie Transport Services. See this [link](https://www.gasunietransportservices.nl/downloads-en-formulieren) and search for 'gasbalans'. This data can also be found if you navigate to the data/nl/source folder.

For historic years (1987, 1997, 2004) the G2A profile is generated using historic weather data and demand parameters provided by NEDU. See the 'script' folder for more information.
